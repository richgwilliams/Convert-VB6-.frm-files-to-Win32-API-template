# Convert-VB6-.frm-files-to-Win32-API-template

This project creates VS 2022 C++ Win32 API grapical template code from a VB6 .frm file.  Its purpose is to facilitate conversion of VB6 header information. In this way an existing VB6 generated graphical layout (controls inside a main window) can be converted into a VS 2022 C++ template using Win32 API calls to create a similar main window containing controls. This is meant as a starting point and as an aid for converting the graphics of a VB6 program into a new C++ program being developed within VS 2022. A short example file called FRM_API.frm is given. It is converted by the program into a csv file (that can be read into Excel) and into FRM_API.api containing C++ source code. The program runs as a CLI application, it expects an input file called FRM_API.frm and immediately converts this into FRM_API.csv and FRM_API.api (in reality the start of a cpp file). The CLI closes exits as soon as the conversion is done. Input file should be in the project folder. Output files appear in the project folder.
