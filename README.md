# Convert-VB6-.frm-files-to-Win32-API-template

This project creates VS 2022 C++ Win32 API grapical template code from a VB6 .frm file.  Its purpose is to facilitate conversion of VB6 header information. A short example file called FRM_API.frm is given. It is converted by the program into a csv file (that can be read into Excel) and into FRM_API.api. The program runs as a CLI application and expects an input file called FRM_API.frm.
